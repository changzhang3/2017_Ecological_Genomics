[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (be sure to install and load the \"knitr\"\" package)\n2. Create a [github](https://github.com/) account and download github [desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)\n\nAccess to my whole project can be found on my [github](https://github.com/adnguyen/2017_Ecological_Genomics).\n\nIt includes this readme file, which I turned into a website you see here, but it also logs research activities on [my online notebook](https://github.com/adnguyen/2017_Ecological_Genomics/blob/master/Online_notebook.md).\n\n### Common code you'll need to word process in (R)markdown  \n\n1. To embed a link, all you need is the URL, implemented in the following way:   \n```\n[hyperlinked words](URL)\n```\n\n2. To embed an image, you'll need a URL of the image, implemented similarly as above:\n```\n![](URL)\n```\nTo get a URL in (R)markdown:\n    * go to your github repository and click **\"Issues\"**    \n    * Click **\"New\"**    \n    * Include a title (Pictures); click and drag any image you'd like into the comment section\n    * Click **\"Submit New Issue\"** \n    * You will see the image, right click it and copy the URL.     \n\n3. To include a table, it is best if you format it first as a csv(comma separated values). (Note, if on a mac, make sure the file type is unicode and unix). With the knitr package, you can generate tables easily from the csv. Here is an example: \n\nGrab a dataset real fast\n```{r}\n#packages for reading in data\nlibrary(data.table)\n\n#grab dataset online\ndat<-fread(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adnguyen/HelmsCahan_CBP-partA_2016/master/Script_Analyses/Sampling_sites_table.csv\")\n\n#making a table\nknitr::kable(dat)\n```\n\n\n\n\n  \n## Assignments   \n1st assignment: [Creating maps in R](RasterPCA_demo.html)\n\n\n## Final Project    \n\nBelow are the set of scripts for my final project.\n\n\n### [good way to annotate your project](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19699059/representing-directory-file-structure-in-markdown-syntax)\n\n",
